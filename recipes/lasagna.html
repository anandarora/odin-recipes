    <h1>Lasagne Recipe for Indian Foodies</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of
      a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other
      recipes. There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found
      necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and
      changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <strong> To freeze an unbaked lasagna:</strong> Line the pan with foil
        before assembling, then assemble the lasagna as directly. Let cool
        completely, and then freeze until solid. Once frozen, lift the frozen
        lasagna block from the casserole dish, wrap it in more foil, then freeze
        for up to a month.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>To reheat an unbaked frozen lasagna:</strong> Remove the lasagna
        from the freezer and unwrap all the layers of foil. Transfer to the
        original casserole dish, cover, and let it thaw in the fridge overnight.
        Once thawed, bake as directed.
